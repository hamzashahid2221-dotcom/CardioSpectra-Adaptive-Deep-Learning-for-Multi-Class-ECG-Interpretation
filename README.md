# 🫀 AI-Assisted Detection of Myocardial Infarction, Abnormal Heartbeat & Normal ECG

This repository presents my research work on developing an **AI-assisted diagnostic system** for detecting **Myocardial Infarction (Heart Attack)**, **Abnormal Heartbeat**, and **Normal** cases from **ECG (Electrocardiogram) images** using **Deep Learning**.  
The model utilizes a **fine-tuned ResNet50** architecture enhanced with an **Adaptive Categorical Focal Loss** function to address class imbalance and improve diagnostic robustness.

## 🎯 Project Overview

Electrocardiography (ECG) remains one of the most widely used and cost-effective diagnostic tools for identifying cardiovascular diseases.  
However, manual ECG interpretation is **time-consuming**, **error-prone**, and highly dependent on clinician expertise, particularly in **resource-limited healthcare environments**.

To support clinical decision-making, I developed an **AI-powered Computer-Aided Diagnostic (CAD)** system capable of classifying ECG images into:

- **Normal**
- **Abnormal Heartbeat**
- **Myocardial Infarction (MI)**

This research lies within the domain of **AI for Cardiology** and **Medical Image Analysis (MIA)**, helping advance early detection of life-threatening cardiac conditions.

## 🧩 Dataset

The dataset used in this study is publicly available on Kaggle:

📌 **Dataset Source:**  
ECG Heartbeat Classification Image Dataset  
🔗 https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/evilspirit05/ecg-analysis

| Class | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Normal** | ECG of individuals without cardiac irregularities |
| **Abnormal Heartbeat** | Irregular ECG pattern (non-MI) |
| **Myocardial Infarction (MI)** | ECG of patients with heart attack |

### Data Split:
- **90% Training**
- **10% Validation**
- There is a seperate dataset for testing. So, seperate dataset is used for testing of model.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

**Base Model:** ResNet50 (pretrained on ImageNet)

Training was conducted in two phases:

1️⃣ **Feature Extraction Phase**  
   - The ResNet50 base was frozen to leverage general visual features.

2️⃣ **Fine-Tuning Phase**  
   - The final **20 layers** of ResNet50 were unfrozen.
   - This allowed learning of domain-specific ECG waveform patterns.

## ⚙️ Adaptive Categorical Focal Loss (Research Contribution)

To overcome class imbalance, especially the relatively lower availability of genuine MI cases, I incorporated a **custom adaptive focal loss**.  
It dynamically updates **α (alpha)** and **γ (gamma)** based on class-wise recall at each epoch.

\[
FL(p_t) = - \alpha_t (1 - p_t)^{\gamma_t} \log(p_t)
\]

### Why Adaptive Loss?
- Traditional focal loss uses fixed α and γ.
- Here, both parameters **self-adjust** to penalize classes with poor recall.
- Creates a **feedback loop** that balances sensitivity across all classes.

> ⚠ Implementation details of the adaptive update mechanism are part of ongoing research and may be published in a future manuscript. Source code is available upon request.
